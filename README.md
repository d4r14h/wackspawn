# WackSpawn

## CLI 
The CLI version is pretty straightforward, just a wrapper for Faker

## GUI
Now, the GUI part is what I'm more proud of. It didn't take long but it's one of my first endeavours building a GUI with python


### Dependencies
* *Faker*
* *PySimpleGUI*
**To install:**
```bash
pip3 install PySimpleGUI Faker
```
